# Ecommerce-ML-Project
This dataset is of an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online.
They also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions.
Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

Aim: To model a machine learning engine to predict the yearly amount spent by a customer.
We should also find out whether the APP or the website experience of the company has to be improved in order for the company to make more profit.

DATA FEATURES: 
1. Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.
2. Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes
3. Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes
4. Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.
5. Yearly Amount Spent: Amount spent by the customer per year.
 
 SEABORN and MATPLOTLIB was used to visualize data.
