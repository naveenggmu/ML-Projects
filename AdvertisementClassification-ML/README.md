# Advertisement-ML-Project
In this project we will be working with a advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

1. 'Daily Time Spent on Site': consumer time on site in minutes
2. 'Age': cutomer age in years
3. 'Area Income': Avg. Income of geographical area of consumer
4. 'Daily Internet Usage': Avg. minutes a day consumer is on the internet
5. 'Ad Topic Line': Headline of the advertisement
6. 'City': City of consumer
7. 'Male': Whether or not consumer was male
8. 'Country': Country of consumer
9. 'Timestamp': Time at which consumer clicked on Ad or closed window
10. 'Clicked on Ad': 0 or 1 indicated clicking on Ad

Logistic Regression was the classifier used.
